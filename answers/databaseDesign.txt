1:- 
As our requirement is to have details about a restaurant and reviews that restaurant has. 
I have created three MySql database tables.

Name of these three tables are 'restaurant' table, 'review' table, and 'admin' table.
However, there wasn't no need to make a admin table, but i have created it just to make application more functional and real.

'restaurant' table has four columns by the name of id, name, address, and description.
'review' table has three columns by the name of id, review, restaurantId.
'admin' table has three columns by the name of id, name, email, password.

'review' table is connected with 'restaurant' table through a column(restaurantId) which contains foreign key.

`Restaurants` (
    `id` INTEGER NOT NULL auto_increment , 
    `name` VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE, 
    `address` VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL, 
    `details` VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
    )
`Reviews` (
    `id` INTEGER NOT NULL auto_increment , 
    `review` VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL, 
    `RestaurantId` INTEGER  FOREIGN KEY  (References to `id` column of `Restaurants` table )
    )
`admins` (
    `id` INTEGER NOT NULL auto_increment ,
    `name` VARCHAR(255), 
    `email` VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE, 
    `password` VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
    )


2:- 
I have created the association between these tables by sequelize ORM. Code snippet is below

Restaurant.hasMany(Review);
Review.belongsTo(Restaurant);
reference :- you can find it in app.js file at line number 32.

For models defination or creation code you can refer to 'models/' folder.


3:- 
SQL QUERY-
SELECT `Restaurant`.`id`, `Restaurant`.`name`, count(`reviews`.`id`) AS `reviewCount` FROM `Restaurants` AS `Restaurant` 
LEFT OUTER JOIN `Reviews` AS `Reviews` ON `Restaurant`.`id` = `Reviews`.`RestaurantId` GROUP BY `restaurant`.`id`;

By ORM-
Restaurant is model for restaurant table

Restaurant.findAll({
    attributes:['id','name',[sequelize.fn('count',sequelize.col('reviews.id')),'reviewCount']],
    include:[
        {
            model: Review,
            attributes:[]
        }
    ],
    group:['restaurant.id']
});
reference :- you can find it in controllers/admin.js file at line number 80.
